__Problem Definition:__ Given the dataset - Appliances Energy Consumption - we are to develop a multiple linear regression model that can predict new energy consumption of an appliance when given new test data. To answer some questions, we will need to normalize the dataset using the MinMaxScaler after removing the following columns: [“date”, “lights”]. The target variable is “Appliances”. Use a 70-30 train-test set split with a random state of 42 (for reproducibility).
